# Outline Client

![Build and Test](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/actions/workflows/build_and_test_debug.yml/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Mattermost](https://badgen.net/badge/Mattermost/Outline%20Community/blue)](https://community.internetfreedomfestival.org/community/channels/outline-community) [![Reddit](https://badgen.net/badge/Reddit/r%2Foutlinevpn/orange)](https://www.reddit.com/r/outlinevpn/)

The Outline Client is a cross-platform VPN or proxy client for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS. The Outline Client is designed for use with the [Outline Server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server) software, but it is fully compatible with any [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) server.

The client's user interface is implemented in [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) 2.0. Platform support is provided by [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), with additional native components in this repository.

2. [Developing for **Android**](docs/android_development.md)
3. [Developing for Electron **(Windows and Linux)**](docs/electron_development.md)

## Error reporting

To enable error reporting through [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for local builds, run:
